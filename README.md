===========

Personal fork of DWMstatus using as base scen (https://github.com/scen/dwmstatus) and Cornu (https://github.com/Cornu/dwmstatus) Dwm statuses.

To add colors you need to put the character ```\x0y``` at the end of the text you want to color, where ```y``` represents the color number. For example:

```Hello World,\x01 Bye\x02```

Would color ```Hello World,``` with color 1 and ``` Bye``` with color 2.
